Fairness-aware Hyperparameter Optimization\n","    *   To achieve the best result, we need to perform hyperparameter optimization (HPO) for the validation accuracy, and hope it generalize well in test set.\n","    *   However, if we only focus on the performance (validation accuracy) during HPO, the model will be unfair in terms of the equal opportunity.\n","    * Therefore, we can perform HPO with the consideration of both validation accuracy and validation fairness score.\n","\n","2.   Generic Resampling\n","    * In Fairness and Bias in AI literature, resampling is adopted to ensure the balance and fairness of the training dataset.\n","    * However, it normally sacrifice the performance (i.e. accuracy) because it may put too much emphasis toward the protected race.\n","    * We propose a generic resampling method for improving the fairness of the model while maintaining the performance.\n","      1.   Split the training dataset into two portions\n","      2.   Use the large portion to resample and fit the first tree of LGBM\n","      3.   Use the small portion to evaluate the fairness score\n","      4.   Based on the fairness score, we adjust the resampling ratio. For instance, if the model is unfair, we increase the resampling ratio toward the protected group.\n","      5.  Use the large portion to resample with the new resampling ratio, and fit the second tree of the model.\n","      6.  Repeat Step 3-5 until we build a whole LGBM\n","
